    Interleave several map-style datasets (sources) into a single map-style dataset.
    The new dataset is constructed by alternating between the sources to get the examples.
    If `probabilities = None` (default) the new dataset is constructed by cycling between each source to get the examples.
    If `probabilities` is not `None, the new dataset is constructed by getting examples from a random source at a time according to the provided probabilities.

    Args:
        datasets (`List[Dataset]`): list of datasets to interleave
        probabilities (`List[float]`, optional, default None): If specified, the new dataset is constructed by sampling
            examples from one source at a time according to these probabilities.
        seed (`int`, optional, default None): The random seed used to choose a source for each example.
        info (:class:`DatasetInfo`, optional): Dataset information, like description, citation, etc.
        split (:class:`NamedSplit`, optional): Name of the dataset split.
        stopping_strategy (`str`, defaults to `first_exhausted`):
            Two strategies are proposed right now.
            By default, `first_exhausted` is an undersampling strategy, i.e the dataset construction is stopped as soon as one dataset has ran out of samples.
            If the strategy is `all_exhausted`,  we use an oversampling strategy, i.e the dataset construction is stopped as soon as every samples of every dataset has been added at least once.
            Note that if the strategy is `all_exhausted`, the interleaved dataset size can get enormous:
            - with no probabilities, the resulting dataset will have max_length_datasets*nb_dataset samples.
            - with given probabilities, the resulting dataset will have more samples if some datasets have really low probability of visiting.
        **kwargs (additional keyword arguments): Keyword arguments to be passed to :meth:`datasets.Datasets.select` when selecting the indices used to interleave the datasets.
